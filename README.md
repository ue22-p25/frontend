# purpose

this repo contains a very short introduction course on the 3 Web pillars : HTML CSS and JavaScript

[![Published](https://img.shields.io/badge/Published-Website-green)](https://frontend.info-mines.paris)

you just need a web browser and a code editor to follow along

## running locally

the course is made of Jupyter notebooks, but **for JavaScript**  
if you want to run the notebooks locally, you will need to install quite a few things; the whole process is a little tedious, it is described in-depth in notebook [80-requirements-nb](notebooks/80-requirements-nb.md)
