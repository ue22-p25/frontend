# purpose

this repo contains a very short introduction course on the 3 Web pillars : HTML CSS and JavaScript

# how to read this course

the recommended way to read this course is to use the readthedocs version,
at <https://ue22-p24-web.readthedocs.io/>

no sophisticated installation is required in this case, just a browser and a
code editor, say chrome and vs-code

# running locally

if you want to run this course locally, you will need to install quite a few things; the whole process is a little tedious, it is described in-depth in notebook [80-requirements-nb](notebooks/80-requirements-nb.md)
