# draft your own CV

## setup

* before you start, make sure to read:
  * [how to setup `vite`](62-vite-nb) which will make your life a hell of a lot easier :)
  * as well as [the section on vs-code tricks](vs-code-tricks-nb) for using VS-code efficiently

the objective is that, once you're properly setted up, you will be able to

- have your vs-code on one side
- your browser on the other side
- and your changes will be reflected live in the browser as you type them in vs-code, without any manual reloading at all !

```{admonition} zoom, do not resize
:class: tip
be wary that you can use keyboard shortcuts  
typically like `Ctrl` + `-` (windows) or `Cmd` + `-` (mac)  
to artificially zoom out if you need to observe how your page behaves in some 'lanscape' geometry

this way you can keep both windows from overlapping too much
```

## assignment

as a conclusion of this first basic course, write your complete resume  
you should have 2 files
  * `resume.html`
  * `resume.css`
* at this point, you may think of it as (if it were) a Word document
  * with a header that has your details and photo
  * and the 4 well structured sections,
  * again *Experience*, *Education*, *Skills* and *Languages*
* try to print it in a PDF file, to evaluate how it fits with respect to an A4 page

````{admonition} important do not worry about the layout for now
:class: note
just focus on the content for now; **focus on structuring** your document properly

but do **not spend too much time** on trying to create **complex layouts**, like multiple columns or such  
our next course will study more powerful tools - grids and flexbox -to address this sort of needs&hellip;
